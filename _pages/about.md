I am a PhD student at FICS Research, University of Florida, advised by Dr. Thomas Shrimpton. I hold an MS in Computer Science from University of Florida, and a BTech in Computer Science from NIT Rourkela. After my BTech, I worked as an engineer for Samung Research Institute, Noida for two years followed by a two year teaching stint at KIIT, Bhubaneswar (my hometown).

My research lies at the intersection of Cryptography and Hardware Security. In particular, I am interested in analysing security problems in the integrated-circuit supply chain using principles of cryptography.
